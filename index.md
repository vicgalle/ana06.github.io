        My name is Ana, I am a Computer Science Engineer and a Mathematician and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at SUSE.

        I love open source and I can not avoid taking a look to every code that crosses my path. That is why I maintain several open source projects and contribute to many others as well. Some people say I am addicted to <a href="https://github.com/Ana06" target="_blank">Github</a>! I also help newcomers to open source, for example by participating as a mentor in GSoC.

        I am passionate about computer science and technology. Lately, I have been mainly working as a software engineer and a web developer, but I also feel attracted by many other fields such as computer architecture, algorithms, machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data and database management. I currently write a lot of Ruby code, but I also like many other programming languages such as assembly, VHDL, C, Java and Haskell, and I am always willing to try new ones.

        As I am a really active person there are many things I usually do. I attend developer and computer science conferences (as a speaker when possible), write viruses in assembly languages and read about technology. I also like travelling, painting, cooking and practising sports. Since I live in Germany, I enjoy learning german too.
