Ana María Martínez Gómez ([@Ana06](https://github.com/Ana06)) personal page: <http://anamaria.martinezgomez.name>

It includes an _About me_ section and a blog.

[Minima gem](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (Jekyll default theme) was used as base. The header and the footer are based on the [Freelancer theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/). The colors and the fonts of the whole app are also taken from there.

Just run `jekyll serve`!

### License and contributions

As you can see in [#22](https://github.com/Ana06/ana06.github.io/issues/22) the license is still not clear. Until that is solved no contributions are accepted. If you have any clue how to solve the license dilemma, all help is welcome, please comment in the issue.
