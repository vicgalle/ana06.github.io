Ana María Martínez Gómez ([@Ana06](https://github.com/Ana06)) personal page: <http://anamaria.martinezgomez.name>

It includes an _About me_ section and a blog.

[Minima gem](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (Jekyll default theme) was used as base. The header and the footer are based on the [Freelancer theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/). The colors and the fonts of the whole app are also taken from there.
